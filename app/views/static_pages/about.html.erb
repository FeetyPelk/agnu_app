<h2>About Batomatic</h2>

<p class="midlish">Batomatic displays baseball pitching and batting statistics for all players on the field, and allows you to drill down into those stats.</p>


<p class="midlish">  You can find the batting average of all players against a given second baseman, for instance. Or see which left-fielder allowed the fewest walks in 1988.
  Or sort a pitcher's ERA, broken down by who is playing shortstop. Or who is playing left field.  Or who is playing shortstop AND who is playing left field.
  Or by who is playing all nine positions (if you're completely nuts), and who the baserunner is on third. And so on.</p>

<p class="midlish">  All stats apply both to the batter (or batting team) and to the fielders.
  ERA, for instance, was originally used as an offensive stat and with Batomatic it can be used that way once again. Some stats make a lot more sense than others when sifted this way, but it's up to you.

<p class="midlish">  Caveats:  There is no data prior to 1970.  Some day, we hope.
